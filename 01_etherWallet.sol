    // receive() A contract can now have only one receive function that is 
    // declared with the syntax receive() external payable {â€¦} (without the 
    // function keyword). It executes on calls to the contract with no data

    // In Solidity, a fallback function is an external function with neither a name, 
    // parameters, or return values. It is executed in one of the following cases: 
    // If a function identifier doesn't match any of the available functions in a 
    // smart contract. If there was no data supplied along with the function call.
    fallback() external payable{}   // must make visisbility external and no arguments.

}


// More on fallback 
// 1). It is executed when a non-existenct function is called on the contract.
// 2). It is required to be marked external.
// 3). It has no name.
// 4). It has no arguments.
// 5). It can not return any thing.
// 6). It can be defined one per contract. 
// 7). If not marked payable, it will throw exception if contract receives ether.
// 8). Its main use is to directly send the ETH to contract.
